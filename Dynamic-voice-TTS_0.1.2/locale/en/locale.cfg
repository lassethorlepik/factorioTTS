[mod-setting-description]
TTS_MOD_player_TTS=If enabled, any message typed by a player will be read by Text-To-Speech voice
TTS_MOD_player_voice_model=This is how your voice sounds to everyone when you talk in chat (check voices.txt in mod files, example: en-GB-RyanNeural or et-EE-KertNeural)
TTS_MOD_distance_limit_enabled=This applies a hearing distance limit to player voices
TTS_MOD_distance_limit=How far proximity chat voices reach (just cuts off logging after limit, does not affect volume)
TTS_MOD_train_stop_voices=Trains will announce current and next stop using Text-To-Speech
TTS_MOD_distance_limit_trains=How far you can hear train announcements (just cuts off logging after limit, does not affect volume)
TTS_MOD_voice_model=Name of the voice model used to render text to you by trains and speakers
TTS_MOD_voice_rate=How fast the voice reads text, example: +0%, plus/minus and percentage sign are required
TTS_MOD_check_delay=How often the program checks for new texts to play (milliseconds), lower values offer better latency but have higher performance cost.
TTS_MOD_startup_message=Reads the startup message when python script is opened
TTS_MOD_train_announcement_text=Text the train voices between saying first and next stop name (include punctuation and spaces)
